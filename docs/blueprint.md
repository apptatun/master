# **App Name**: Momentum

## Core Features:

- Empathy Hook: Opening sequence recognizing the user's situation: feeling stuck despite being technically an adult. Validates those feelings and offers a path forward.
- Gamified Challenges: Presents initial small tasks/missions framed as 'vivencias' (lived experiences) or 'micro-victories,' recontextualizing ordinary chores in terms that are gamified and rewarding
- Identity-based Rewards: Presents progress in the system with 'identity rewards', awarding ironic but empowering titles like "Master of the Microwave" to build confidence
- Interactive Assistance: Step-by-step guides for initial missions. Offers detailed assistance without infantilizing users. Provides users full control through skippable steps, designed for various skill and comfort levels.
- Naming AI Assistant: Suggests the names for things to name based on hints, acting as a tool to assist when starting missions to suggest fun options and generate momentum
- Personal Support: Offers daily tips and phrases of support. A journal writing space where a user can safely record the wins and losses of their day to keep a strong record.
